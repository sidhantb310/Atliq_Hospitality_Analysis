# Provide Insights to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain

**Problem Statement:**
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Objective:**
As a Data Analyst, the objective was to create a comprehensive dashboard that would equip the revenue management team with valuable insights and actionable information. Throughout this journey, I collaborated closely with stakeholders, diligently understanding their specific needs and requirements.

**Data Information:**
The dataset used for this analysis was collected from CodeBasics website (Resume Project Challenge #1).
